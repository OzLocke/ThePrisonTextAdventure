# ThePrisonTextAdventure
A text adventure built during the Udemy Learn to Code with Unity course

## About
This repo is for a simple game being developed as part of the Udemy Unity course available here: https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/

I have gone away from the basic structure ebnough to need source control for the project

## Current State
The game is complete. All that remains is testing, confirming scoring and endings work, and checking the text flow speed.
