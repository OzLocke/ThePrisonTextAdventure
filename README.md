# ThePrisonTextAdventure
A text adventure built during the Udemy Learn to Code with Unity course

## About
This repo is for a simple game being developed as part of the Udemy Unity course available here: https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/

I have gone away from the basic structure ebnough to need source control for the project

## Current State
The game is incomplete, but all of the framework has been built and the majority of the work now involved should be on fleshing out the story and gameplay
